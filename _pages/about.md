Welcome! I'm a student at UC Berkeley majoring in Computer Science/Data Science and minoring in Global Studies. In my free time, you'll find me playing volleyball at open gym, experimenting with air fryer recipes, chipping away at my annual [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57533277-ellie) goal, or falling down a YouTube rabbit hole!
